# **BinaryOxide Ubuntu**

A personal Ubuntu setup created for my own workflow, experiments, and customization.  
This repository stores my configs, themes, tweaks, and notes — mainly for my own use, but anyone is free to explore or use them if they find something helpful.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository helps me:

- Keep my Ubuntu customizations safe  
- Restore my setup on new installs  
- Track changes to configs  
- Experiment with themes, scripts, and system tweaks  
- Maintain a consistent developer environment  

Everything here is **personal**, but **public**.

- **Package Lists**  
  The applications, PPAs, and Flatpaks I use.
